The Main reason for the development of the "3S" dapp is to bring a new level of transperancy in the distribution of Scholarship to the students in kerala. Initially we are developing an decentralized application for SSLC and PLUS TWO students who are writting the board exam.There are several students who require a support from the goverment organization and many other several organisations including NGO's.But in real case scenario many misuses of scholarship amounts are done.So inorder to avoid that misuses and to bring transperancy at its best,we are designing this dapp on a private blockchain network(ethereum).So that if there is any controversy in future.We can track the transaction.

The scholarship amount awarded to each student is calculated by the smart contract based on certain conditions.
The Token "SCHOLAR (3S)" is awarded to the students based on the scholarship Amount obtained, by the contract deployer.
These tokens can be used by students for there personel education related purchases.
Buy avoiding the fiat currency distribution and distributing tokens help to avoid malecious transactions and misuses of scholarship amount and also can track the transactions done by the students.     




The following are considered in background for the full functionality of 3S D-app

1. A Wallet named " 3S Wallet" similar to metamask or myEtherwallet is required for the students to create an account.
2. The dapp is designed for the private network of the educational ministry of kerala which consist of 14 nodes,each full node in each district under the educational ministry and the mining is done by these nodes.
3. Difficulty in the genesis file should be set in such a way that less power consuption required for mining.
4. Works on PoW Consensus Mechanism.
5. Each Node should contain an Ethereum Client "GETH" in which the private network is running.





In Smart Contract, the "ScholarshipToken" smart contract is defined with certain functions such as totalSupply(), approve(), allowance() and event Approval, which is not used in this dapp. It is defined inorder to make smart contract "ScholarshipToken" ERC20 compliant.


There are several advantages for this dapp ie the students comes to know about the technology and one of the great advantage is immutable ledger and transparency.
